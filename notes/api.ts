/*
APIs

Create an api folder under app. Then create the resource/model folder. Then create
a route.tsx folder to specific actions for HTTP request types.

Use NextRequest and NextResponse to handle receiving and sending data.
Next response can take in an error code as well with the first arg being the error
message, and the second arg being another object with a status code number.
